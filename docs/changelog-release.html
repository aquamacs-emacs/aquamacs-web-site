  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a compatibility issue with macOS Mojave.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs is now compiled and distributed with a copy of the
    gnutls library to enable secure web connections. The version in
    this distribution is 3.6.8. Only the shared library and its
    library dependencies are included. This was done because Emacs
    has removed support for using the openssl command line tool
    shipped with Mac OS X. Code for building the libraries
    contributed by Win Treese. License information for these
    libraries is included the manual.</li>

    <li>In order to provide compatibility with gnutls, the oldest
    supported version of Mac OS X is now El Capitan (10.11).</li>

    <li>This version also bundles the binary shared library for the
    libxml2 library (version 2.9.9).</li>

    <li>ESS has been updated to version 18.10.2. See here for all
    new features: <tt><a name="tex2html39" href=
    "http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#New-features" id=
    "tex2html39">http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#New-features</a></tt>.</li>

    <li>Known bug (MacOS Mojave): menus may require a double click
    to open with the mouse. When this happens, go to System
    Preferences, Security&amp;Privacy, Accessibility, and allow
    Aquamacs to ``control your computer''. This merely enables
    Aquamacs to process some UI events. (Note that this workaround
    does not apply to nightly builds because they lack a code
    signature.)</li>

    <li>Bug fix: a rare condition (when Tabs are not in used) could
    occur where frames will be unresponsive to user input. Reported
    by Lewis Hyatt.</li>

    <li>Bug fix: Color lists were unavailable on late MacOS
    versions. Reported by Max Arnold.</li>
