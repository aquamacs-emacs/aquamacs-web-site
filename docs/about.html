    <p><strong>Aquamacs</strong> is a user-friendly build of the powerful <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> text
    editor.  Aquamacs integrates with the Mac and offers the same
    comforts that any application on the Mac provides.  Yet, it comes
    with all the ergonomy and extensibility you've come to expect from
    GNU Emacs. It's beeen adapted by <a
    href="http://www.david-reitter.com/" alt="Reitter">David
    Reitter</a>, based on GNU Emacs by Richard Stallman and many
    others.
    <p>
    Aquamacs has been available for about a decade and
    is used daily by thousands of academics, programmers, and
    authors.  It is backed by two strong communities: Aquamacs users,
    and Emacs enthusiasts on all computing platforms (GNU/Linux/Unix,
    Windows, Mac).

    
    <p><b>What's Emacs?</b> Emacsis a text editor of legendary power and
    configurability, but it also has an enormously complex user
    interface. One advantage of it is: no matter what operating
    system you run Emacs on, you'll always get the same interface.
    The big challenge: if you use a number of applications on your
    Mac, one of them is Emacs, you'll have to switch gears when you
    switch to Emacs.</p>

    <p><b>Aquamacs is better.</b> We support the standard Mac user
    interface that you've come to love. For instance, in addition
    to traditional Emacs shortcuts like C-x C-f (open a new file),
    Aquamacs understands Command-O. Aquamacs behaves like a modern
    application on Mac (or Windows) when it comes to selecting,
    copying, pasting texts within Aquamacs or in between
    applications. Aquamacs offers nice, smooth fonts. Asian input
    methods work. It's easy to install and runs out-of-the box with
    no configuration. And all is built on GNU Emacs, so you can use
    your favorite Emacs packages! Check the <a href=
    "features.html">Features section</a> if you want to know
    more.</p>

    <p><b>Who made it?</b> Aquamacs has been adapted from GNU Emacs by <a
     alt="Reitter" href="http://www.david-reitter.com">David
    Reitter</a>, aided by enthusiastic users and Emacs
    experts. Collaborator <a
     href="http://www.nebrwesleyan.edu/users/ncunning" alt="Cunningham">Nathaniel Cunningham</a> has contributed
     features such as native spell-checking and window tabs.
    Project co-founder Kevin Walzer has contributed
    easy-to-understand manuals. There is a long list of contributors,
     including those who wrote included packages and, of course,
     Emacs.
    GNU Emacs has a long history that
    began some fourty years ago, primarily driven by the efforts of
    GNU founder <a href="http://stallman.org/">Richard M. Stallman</a>.  GNU Emacs has first been ported
    to the Mac by Andrew Choi; the Cocoa port was written by Adrian
     Robert and colleagues; much Mac development of Emacs was done by 
     Yamamoto Mitsuharu.</p>
