        <h1>Beta 2 release of Aquamacs 3.6</h1>

        <p>
            The beta 2 release of Aquamacs 3.6 is now available (<a href="https://aquamacs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Aquamacs-3.6-beta2.dmg">download</a>).

        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the original beta release, the beta 2 update fixes
          a problem with AUCTeX and RefTeX introduced in beta 1, and also fixes
          some other memory management problems.
      </p>
        <p>
            This release has fixes for many of the reported crashes
            and other bugs, particularly for crashes on Catalina and
            Big Sur. Aquamacs now prompts for needed permissions. The
            Aquamacs app is now fully signed and notarized by Apple.
            Several of the bundled Emacs Lisp packages have been
            updated to more recent versions, most notably AUCTeX.
        </p>
        <p>
            This version also include native support for libxml2 as
            well as JPEG and SVG images.
        </p>
        <p>
            This release is compiled to run on any Mac OS version from
            El Capitan (10.11) forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, the 3.6 is compiled only for the x86
            architecture. It generally runs fine on Apple Silicon system
            with Rosetta. Unfortunately, a native version on Apple Silicon
            will have to wait for Aquamacs 4.0.
        </p>
        <p>
            Known problems:
            <ul>
                <li> The help system doesn't work properly at first.
                    Usually, Mac OS seems to build an index for it that works
                    later. The out-of-the-box setup should work better in the
                    final version of 3.6.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For anyone interested in hacking on Aquamacs or building
            it themselves, the build system has been refactored
            somewhat to make it easier to build for personal use. Look
            in the aquamacs/build directory to find the scripts that
            do the work.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are no major issues, I expect the final release
            of 3.6 to be in early November.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aquamacs 3.6 will likely be the last release based on
            Emacs 25. Beyond 3.6, Aquamacs will be updated to run with
            a fairly recent version of Emacs 27 or Emacs 28, depending
            on when the development catches up. The merge to catch up
            with current Emacs will probably take a while, although
            there's been a lot of behind-the-scenes work to set the
            stage for that.

            Some of you have asked about donations. Thanks for your
            interest in supporting Aquamacs development. The project
            paused donations with the change in maintainers, and something
            new may be set up after the 3.6 final release is
            available. If you would like to be notified about that,
            please email <a
