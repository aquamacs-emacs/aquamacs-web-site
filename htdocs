<LI>Aquamacs now handles paragraphs better that are stored as single lines in the buffer: these very long ``lines'' are shown as paragraphs, with words wrapped were appropriate.  The wrap functions in the Options menu will use the new technique.  As a result, line numbers shown in Aquamacs correspond to line numbers in the file.  Also, word wrap will work better now with variable-width fonts.  Syntax highlighting is now correct in all situations, because it is based on the line separation in the underlying file and not on what's displayed  (`longlines-mode' is not used any longer; a new variable `word-wrap' controls the display-time word wrapping.)
Code by Kim F. Storm, Chong Yidong, David Reitter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The end of file lines (newlines) or paragraph endings in soft word wrapping can be visualized via Option / Show/Hide / Show Newlines (`global-show-newlines-mode').

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Symbols in the fringes have been adapted to look less conspicuous. (These are the indicators to the left and right of text lines.)
Code by Kim F. Storm.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The ``small left fringe'' setting in the Show/Hide menu works again as intended.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Automatic wrapping detection (hard word wrap = auto-fill, vs.~soft word wrap) improved.  A new customization option `auto-word-wrap-default-function' may be used to configure the default, which is hard word wrapping.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Navigation in buffers (up/down) optimized and improved.  This is also a new buffer-local mode (`visual-line-mode'), which is enabled globally (`global-visual-line-mode').  That's also what the ``vl'' mode line indicator stands for.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-Backspace will remove the whole visual line now (`kill-whole-visual-line'), while Command-Shift-Backspace will remove the entire buffer line (which may be a paragraph, when soft wrap is on). 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Environment variables are imported again in most situations despite bugs in OS X / Emacs.  This issue could cause LaTeX calls to fail. The *Messages* buffer contains helpful notices. Reported by Thomas S. Dye and others.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An issue where pressing M-Backspace (especially in the minibuffer) could lead to an error message has been resolved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An issue where the Mac (system) input method would automatically switch to US or Romaji (in Japanese modes) has been resolved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An issue where a ``buffer is read-only'' message appeared when quitting Aquamacs after some buffer was printed has been resolved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The frame size, which is retained across sessions, is not limited to what is available on the screen: frames cannot be bigger any longer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A toolbar item to revert the buffer (M-x revert-buffer) is now available (configure with Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar items)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A new customization variable `set-region-to-isearch-match' has been introduced so that users can turn off a relatively new option that lets Aquamacs set the region to the latest search match (Command-F/G and Shift-Command-G).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Help menu (in ``Diagnose and Report Bug'') provides a way to start another Aquamacs Emacs instance without any personal customizations.  This should be used to reproduce any potential bugs before reporting them.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>LaTeX configuration (standard paths) simplified.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Auto Frame Styles are turned on automatically when the user chooses to retain frame settings (colors, fonts) for a mode or as a default.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tabs and Windows can now be removed without killing the buffer shown (Window or tab context menu, Emacs function `tabbar-delete-current-tab').

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Searching for keywords in the Help menu now includes the Emacs Manual and the Emacs Lisp Reference.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Structure of Help menu revised.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>in SLIME (Lisp mode) and ERC, the Aquamacs tabs work again. (`slime-header-line-p' and `erc-header-line-format' now default to nil. `erc-mode-line-format' has a new default value. Customize these variables to revert to the old behavior.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Incompatibility with VM (an optional install)  removed.
Reported by Jos&#233; Figueroa-O'Farrill.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Internal change: Full-screen editing is now handled via the
  frame parameter `fullscreen'.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Further minor bug fixes.
