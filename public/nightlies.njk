    <h1>The Cutting Edge: Aquamacs Nightly Builds</h1>

    <p>If you'd like to stay on top of the game, download our
    nightly builds. These are produced from current development
    snapshots of GNU Emacs and Aquamacs, straight from their
    respective repositories.</p>

    <p> <a href="#changelog-latest">The list of changes to date is
   available.</a>  
   </p> 
    <p>Building the nightlies may fail occasionally - that's part
    of why we do them. If that happens and you're tech savvy,
    please do check the
    log provided and try to fix the problem.</p>
  <h2>Reporting Problems</h2>

      <h2>Unidentified Developer: Digital Signature</h2>

      While regular Aquamacs releases are digitally signed, the nightly
      builds are not (for security reasons).  This means that you may
      get an error message when first starting up a freshly downloaded
      Aquamacs: "Aquamacs can't be opened because it is from an
      unidentified developer.".
  <p>
      To work around this, just double-click on the app in Finder while
      holding the Control button.  You only need to do this once.
  <p>
      You can verify the source of your download by making sure that it
      comes from "aquamacs.org", the official internet domain of the
      Aquamacs project.
